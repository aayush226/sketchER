### sketchER is a Rough Hand-Drawn style Database Modelling tool to create Entity-Relationship diagrams and SQL Statements.

**sketchER** can be used to make both, Logical and Physical Schemas of your database.


- Sketch out idea of your database into a ER diagram (Logical Schema)
- Convert your sketch into a Physical or Relational form (Automatic Logical to Physical Schema conversion feature coming soon!) with basic **CRUD** operations 
- Translate Relational Schema into code easily by clicking "Export to SQL" to generate SQL statements
- Copy & Paste the SQL statements to your Oracle Server and click run to build your database!


Additionally, you can download your ER diagram as png by clicking "Save".

sketchER has all standard ER diagram components like : *Entity, Weak Entity, Associative Entity, Attribute, Multi-Valued Attribute, Derived Attribute, Strong Relationship, Weak Relationship, Aggregation, Specialization* and *Generelization*. *Total Participation* and *Partial Participation* components are also provided.

**Example** : **Facebook Database**

Start sketching [here!](https://aayush226.github.io/sketchER/)

sketchER is built on top of [**Rough.js**](https://roughjs.com/) which gives it a sketchy and hand-drawn-like style. Fill styles like : *hachure, solid, zigzag, cross-hatch, dots, dashed* and *zigzag-line* are accessible. Additionally, *stroke width, stroke color, fill color* and *font colors* can also be controlled.
